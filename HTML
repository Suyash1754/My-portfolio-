        <h2>PROJECT 1:- 
           HAND GESTURE CONTROL USING RASPBERRY PI
          </h2>
          <h3>ABSTRACT:-</h3>
        <p>The idea behind a gesture control project using a Raspberry Pi
          involves combining computer vision and machine learning to
          recognize hand gestures. This project uses a Raspberry Pi as the
          core hardware, a camera module for image capture, and software
          components like OpenCV for gesture recognition. The project
          processes gestures, applies logic, and displays the outcome on the
          screen. It's a hands-on project that blends technology, image
          processing, and AI for interaction with the computer</p>

        <h2>PROJECT 2:- PLAGIARISM DETECTION SYSTEM </h2>
         <h3>ABSTRACT:-</h3>
        <p>Plagiarism detection is a critical concern in various domains, including academia, literature, and intellectual property protection. This abstract presents a novel approach to address plagiarism detection specifically in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) applications. Handwriting differentiation and analysis are essential components of this algorithm, which aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of plagiarism detection in documents containing handwritten text.
          The proposed algorithm extracts unique features from handwritten content, enabling the algorithm to distinguish between different authors or sources. Additionally, the algorithm employs text recognition to convert handwritten text into machine-readable format, which facilitates comparison with other documents.
          The algorithm's implementation demonstrates promising results in various OCR applications, including academic research, historical document analysis, and legal document verification. This method greatly advances the state-of-the-art in plagiarism detection by addressing the frequently disregarded domain of handwritten text</p>

      <h2>PROJECT 3:- CPU ARCHITECTURE TO CONTROL WASHING MACHINES</h2>
      <h3>ABSTRACT:- </h3>
      <p> 
        The project "CPU Architecture to Control Washing Machines" is an in-depth investigation into the design and implementation of a specialized Central Processing Unit (CPU) architecture tailored for intelligent washing machine control. In response to the changing landscape of household appliances, this project aims to create a sophisticated CPU system capable of seamlessly orchestrating multiple operations within a washing machine. The goals include optimizing resource utilization, dynamically adapting to various washing scenarios, improving user interactions through customizable interfaces, and incorporating advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) for remote control capabilities. To improve the overall performance and reliability of washing machines, an emphasis is placed on energy efficiency, fault tolerance, and the potential integration of artificial intelligence (AI). The project hopes to achieve a paradigm shift in the functionality of washing machines by aligning them with the demands of modern households as well as advancements in CPU architecture and smart technologies.

      <h2>PROJECT 4:- 
        STUDENT DATA ENTRY
       </h2>
       <h3>ABSTRACT:-</h3>
     <p>This project contains a simple C program for student data entry. It allows users to add, display, and search for student records in an organized manner. The program uses basic C structures and file I/O for data persistence. Perfect for beginners learning C or working on small-scale student management systems.</p>
